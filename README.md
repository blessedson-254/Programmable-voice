# Programmable-voice
Voice Application Using Virtual Number
This is a survey application to be used by county governments in areas faced with extreme hunger, water shortage, and medical emergency conditions.

The application uses the Africa Talking voice API to accomplish these objectives.

Individuals living within arid areas are issued with a toll free number for reporting these adverse conditions.

The data collected is real-time and accurate (as it does not rely on past incidences of hunger, drought, or sicknesses).

The data entered by callers is captured on the Ongea Application dashbord for immediate response.

The App could also be used by other counties facing droughts and other emergencies as well as making decision on areas to offer food or medical charity donations.
